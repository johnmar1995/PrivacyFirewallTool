Sorry for the inconvenience, I already submitted it to Microsoft!

Microsoft Defender detects it as a virus!

# Windows Stealth

**Windows Stealth** is a GUI application that allows users to enable or disable stealth mode on their system. Stealth mode restricts incoming ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 (ping) requests and disables network discovery for open ports and file sharing services, effectively making the system "invisible" on a local network.

## Features

- ✅ Enable and disable Windows Firewall stealth settings.
- 🔒 Block both ICMPv4 (ping) and ICMPv6 (ping6) on "Enable Stealth"
- 🚫 Disable File, Printer Sharing, and Network Discovery.
- 📡 Easy click and block Nmap Stealth SYN Scan.
- 🖥️ Simple, retro-style built with system tray.
