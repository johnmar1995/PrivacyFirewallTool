# 🔐 Privacy Firewall Tool

**Privacy Firewall Tool** is a lightweight, user-friendly GUI app that lets you **enable or disable stealth mode** on your Windows system with a single click. Stealth mode blocks incoming ICMP (ping) requests and disables file sharing and network discovery, helping make your device invisible on local networks — a simple privacy defense layer against common scanning tools like **Nmap**.
