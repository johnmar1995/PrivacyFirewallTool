# Windows Stealth

**Windows Stealth** is a PowerShell-based Windows Forms application that allows users to enable or disable stealth mode on their system. Stealth mode restricts incoming ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 (ping) requests and disables network discovery for open ports and file sharing services, effectively making the system "invisible" on a local network.

## Features

- ✅ Enable and disable Windows Firewall stealth settings.
- 🔒 Block both ICMPv4 (ping) and ICMPv6 (ping6) on "Enable Stealth"
- 🚫 Disable File and Printer Sharing and Network Discovery.
- 📡 Easy click and block Nmap Stealth SYN Scan for open ports.
- 🖥️ Simple, retro-style GUI built with system tray icon status.
