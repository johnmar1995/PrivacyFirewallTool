Privacy Firewall Tool is a user-friendly GUI application designed to enable or disable stealth mode on your Windows system. When activated, stealth mode blocks incoming ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 (ping) requests and disables network discovery for open ports and file sharing services, effectively making your device less visible on local networks.

🔐 Features
✅ Toggle stealth settings in the Windows Firewall with one click.

🔒 Block both ICMPv4 (ping) and ICMPv6 (ping6) when stealth is enabled.

🚫 Disable File and Printer Sharing, as well as Network Discovery.

📡 Simple toggle to help mitigate Nmap stealth SYN scans.

🖥️ Lightweight, retro-style UI.
